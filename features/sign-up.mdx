## Overview

Users begin by registering an account. On the Sign-Up page, they are given two options:
- Enter their email and password
- Click a social login button

After filling out the appropriate form fields, they click the "Create Account" button. If users opt for a Pro subscription, they are directed to the payment interface.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Form validation should include:
  - Email format verification
  - Password strength requirements
  - Duplicate email checking
- Social login implementations should use official SDKs
- Pro subscription flow should integrate with payment processor
- All form submissions should be protected against CSRF
- Implement rate limiting for sign-up attempts
